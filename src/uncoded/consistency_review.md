# Semantic Consistency Review

Review a Python codebase for concrete disagreements in its vocabulary and symbol
contracts. A finding must identify two claims about the same concept that ought
to agree, but do not.

## Guardrails

Admit a finding only when the codebase supports both claims, their observable
difference, and the reason that they should agree. Quote both claims verbatim.
Omit a candidate when either claim or the reason for comparing them is
unsupported.

Review semantic and naming consistency, not formatting or style consistency. Do
not report general bugs, complexity, performance, security, or design
preferences unless they appear as a disagreement between two supported claims.
Do not report overgrown public surfaces, private imports, cross-domain imports,
zero-reference symbols, or redundant public surfaces merely because they exist.

## Prerequisites

Run the repository's configured `uncoded sync` command. Read the repository's
agent instructions and follow its navigation rules.

## Orientation

Read `.uncoded/namespace.yaml` in full. Use its package structure and symbol
names to map the codebase's main concepts and vocabulary.

## Vocabulary sweep

Use the namespace and stubs to find candidates, then confirm semantic overlap
from signatures, docstrings, or bodies. Look for:

- **Competing terms:** different names for substantively the same concept.
- **Conflicting use:** the same term used incompatibly within a shared context.
- **Stale qualifiers:** names such as `legacy`, `v2`, or `final` whose
  distinction conflicts with another symbol or a symbol's docstring.

Similar spelling, low vocabulary overlap, or the presence of a qualifier is not
evidence on its own. A finding needs two concrete claims that establish the
shared concept and the disagreement.

## Symbol-contract sweep

Compare a symbol's name, signature, docstring, and, when needed, behaviour.
Findings may cover:

- name-signature disagreement
- name-docstring disagreement
- docstring-signature disagreement
- name-behaviour disagreement

Read each relevant source file's stub for names and signatures. Run the
repository's configured `uncoded body` command only when a docstring or
implementation is needed to confirm a candidate. Do not retrieve every symbol
body.

## Report

Return the report directly as the final turn output.

Use this structure:

```markdown
## Semantic Consistency Review

### Scope

<What was reviewed and intentionally omitted.>

### Summary

<Two or three sentences that summarise the supported findings.>

### Vocabulary findings

#### 1. <Summary>

**Claim A** — `<path>` · `<symbol>` · name | signature | docstring | body

> Verbatim evidence

**Claim B** — `<path>` · `<symbol>` · name | signature | docstring | body

> Verbatim evidence

**How they differ:** <The observable disagreement.>

**Why these should agree:** <Evidence that both claims describe the same
concept.>

### Symbol-contract findings

#### 1. <Summary>

<Use the same finding structure.>
```

Keep both finding headings. If a group has no supported findings, state that
under its heading. Number findings independently within each group.

## Examples

### Vocabulary finding

#### 1. Customer lookup uses competing verbs

**Claim A** — `storage.py` · `fetch_customer` · signature

> `fetch_customer(customer_id: str) -> Customer`

**Claim B** — `adapter.py` · `load_customer` · signature

> `load_customer(customer_id: str) -> Customer`

**How they differ:** The same lookup uses `fetch` in one module and `load` in
another.

**Why these should agree:** Both signatures accept a customer ID and return a
customer through sibling adapters.

### Symbol-contract finding

#### 1. Predicate name promises a boolean but returns a value

**Claim A** — `cache.py` · `is_cached` · name

> `is_cached`

**Claim B** — `cache.py` · `is_cached` · signature

> `is_cached(key: str) -> str | None`

**How they differ:** The name promises a predicate, while the return type holds
a cached value or absence.

**Why these should agree:** Both claims describe the contract of `is_cached`.

**Non-finding.** `archive_record(record)` and `delete_record(record)` have
similar signatures, but their docstrings distinguish retained records from
permanently removed records. The codebase supports two concepts, so omit the
candidate.
